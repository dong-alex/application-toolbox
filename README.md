# Application Toolbox

Store a personal collection of important URLs used in job applications such as Github, LinkedIn, and personal sites. As well, store a variety of descriptions for your work experience, to fully compensate for the variety of job portals that companies may use.

This will overall reduce the number of duplicate tabs and unnecessary browsing to find them. Keep it on the side while you apply for your first or next job.
